    <h3>About</h3>
    
    <p>Hi, my name is Marsel.</p>
<p>I am <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marselester">a software developer</a>
interested in databases and distributed systems biased towards Go and Python.</p>
<p>In early 2020 I moved to Canada to explore a new continent.
Before that I lived in Thailand and traveled around South East Asia for 8 years.
There I was introduced to joy of motorcycle riding and technical challenges it presented,
firstly as a mode of transportation, later touring, and eventually competitions.</p>
<p>I've participated in four <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;marselester/lessons-learned-from-motorcycle-riding-5d55f42ee744">circuit races</a> taking third place in one of them,
apart from that I reduced my personal lap time from 58 to 52.57 seconds.
After that I shifted my focus to off-road (motocross, enduro)
and soon discovered the lack of foundational skills impeding my progress.
I found out that <a class="reference external" href="https://marselester.com/instagram/content/201911_17864684032553298.mp4">motorcycle trials</a>,
while being a sport in its own right, was the way to go.
With practice I've been gradually improving and discovered in process that I like trials more than other motorsports.
Following this I found confidence to join competitions first in a beginner class,
then in C class, and in 2019 tried my skills in B class.</p>
<p>However I started out as an artist in Russia.
I enjoyed doodling since early childhood. At first opportunity
I passed exams and left home at age of 10 to study at arts boarding school in the city
as I wanted to learn how to draw better.
Besides all the regular classes I filled my spare time with extra-curricular painting courses.
Occasionally my works were chosen to join school and regional contests and exhibitions.</p>
<p>At around age of twelve I got interested in websites
when a teacher showed how to use frames in Netscape Navigator.
The same weekend I went to a book fair to buy books on HTML/web-design and
I've been developing web applications for fun and profit ever since.
I participated in school competitions on informatics and had an opportunity
to join regionals though results showed that my knowledge wasn't on par.
Nevertheless it was an important experience for me.</p>
<p>By fourth year I realized that my passion for computers overtook my interest in academic art,
so I changed schools to get prepared to eventually apply and join CS program in a local university.</p>
<p>Once I've graduated with MS degree I took off to travel as
during my last summer holidays at the university I went to Europe in my first trip abroad
and was stricken with wanderlust that brought me to Thailand.</p>
