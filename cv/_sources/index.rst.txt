It is important for me to solve meaningful problems with high impact.
I find professional satisfaction in building reliable services, reasoning about their boundaries,
writing documentation and clear code.

I prefer Go, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Kubernetes, SaltStack/Ansible.

Work Experience
---------------

**Senior Software Engineer** (Python/Go), **Software Architect** (since August 2017) at fintech startup Coins.ph_ üöÄ
July 2014 ‚Äî September 2020

I developed a wallet service (multi-currency payments including Bitcoin/Ethereum)
which helped the company to grow from thousands to over 10 millions of customers.
Later I designed a new ledger (Go, PostgreSQL, Kafka) to solve scalability issues,
and led the team that focused on its delivery.

In early days I set up infrastructure based on SaltStack.
It helped to quickly provision dozens of EC2 instances to cope with exponential growth (it's Kubernetes nowadays).
I introduced ELK, Prometheus, Jaeger to help developers with troubleshooting.

I also decoupled and refactored services from Flask monolith to scale them independently, e.g.,
currency quotes service, account management service (sign up/in, TFA).

All along I've been improving code quality, architecture and advocating for both
(conventions/proposals gardening similar to Go proposals).

**Python Developer** at icon fonts generator Fontastic_ (Webalys_) üôÇ
January 2014 ‚Äî July 2014

As a contractor I started with Django code quality improvements
(refactoring, writing tests/docs) and infrastructure as code (Ansible).

Then I focused on improving project monetization:
SVG sprite hosting and billing (recurring PayPal payments, usage limits of font hosting,
coroutine based AWS S3 and CloudFront log analyzer).

**Python Developer** at cloud-based file upload SaaS Uploadcare_ üÜô
November 2012 ‚Äî August 2013

I helped with customer dashboards, monetization (payments integration with Stripe),
and maintaining API library pyuploadcare_ (mass refactoring, documentation_,
Python 3 support, first major release).

**Python Developer** at concert organization startup FanGid.com_ ü§ü
July 2012 ‚Äî October 2012

Right after graduation I met a concerts organizer who was looking for developers to build a startup.
The idea was to gauge music fans interest, bring most wanted musicians, and sell tickets.
I pitched it to a fellow developer, and we launched the project in 3 months.

I helped to set up the project's foundation and system's architecture.
Then I worked on the following Django components:
social auth, voting system, concert's pages, singer's profile page,
displaying similar bands, email sending, monetization (tickets, orders, discounts, payments).

----

I had started my career in small web studios.

**Software Engineer**, **Senior Software Engineer** at web studio Bestweb_ üëç
August 2007 ‚Äî January 2012

Still studying at university I continued my work on standard corporate websites
but this time using CodeIgniter (PHP framework).
To my best knowledge about 20 websites ran on a CMS I developed.

**Software Engineer**, **Senior Software Engineer** at web studio `Parus Media`_ ‚õµÔ∏è
April 2006 ‚Äî June 2007

In my freshman/sophomore years I worked as a full stack developer of standard corporate websites
using vanilla PHP and MySQL.
The most challenging project was a regional portal SamRU_ (~80K pageviews per day)
for which I wrote the following modules:
forum, job board, weather forecast widget, billboard, catalog of products, banner system, etc.

In 2005 I enrolled in Samara State Aerospace University and then in 2007 decided to
move to my hometown, so I continued the curriculum at
Ufa State Aviation Technical University from which I graduated in 2012 with
Master's degree in Computer Science.
