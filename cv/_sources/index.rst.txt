Work Experience
---------------

**Senior Software Engineer** (Python/Go) at Coins.ph_, financial services based on Bitcoin
July 2014 — Present

In two months onboard I developed the wallet system which is our core service.
I keep improving it still.

At the same time I set up continuous integration and infrastructure
based on SaltStack (production, staging, beta and sandbox servers).
Also I wrote a number of Python API clients.

All along I've been improving code quality & architecture and advocating for both,
decoupling services from the legacy monolithic system
towards microservices. For example, the currency quotes service,
the account service which provides auth flow.

**Python Developer** at icon fonts generator Fontastic_ (Webalys_)
January 2014 — July 2014 (remote)

I started with Django code quality improvements (refactoring, tests, documentation, bug fixes),
helping with infrastructure based on Ansible. Also I worked on billing
(recurring PayPal payments, font hosting limitation control,
coroutine based S3 and CloudFront log analyzer) and SVG sprite hosting.

**Python Developer** at open software projects incubator Joltem_
October 2013 — November 2013 (remote)

I had joined the project (it used Django, Twisted) when infrastructure
was not set up, so I participated in setting it up based on SaltStack,
refactoring Django project.

**Python Developer** at social advertising platform Sociate_
August 2013 — September 2013 (remote)

Mainly I was involved in Odnoklassniki API integration with Django,
e.g., I wrote `Odnoklassniki REST API wrapper`_.

**Python Developer** at cloud-based file upload SaaS Uploadcare_
November 2012 — August 2013 (remote)

I started to work at Uploadcare from tasks that helped me to get familiar with
the infrastructure quicker (Django, Tornado, Flask, Chef). After that I engaged
mostly with Django (payments integration with Stripe_, customer dashboard)
and maintaining API library pyuploadcare_ (mass refactoring, documentation_,
Python 3 support, first major release).

**Python Developer** at concert organization startup FanGid.com_
July 2012 — October 2012

Right after graduation I met a guy who was looking for developers to build a startup.
As I joined early on, I had participated in setting project
foundation and system architecture. During my time there I worked on social authorization,
voting system, concert's pages, singer's profile, downloading similar bands,
email sending, trading subsystem (tickets, orders, discounts, payments).

----

While studying I had been working as PHP developer.

**Software Engineer**, **Senior Software Engineer** at web studio Bestweb_
August 2007 — January 2012

I've developed numerous websites using PHP/CodeIgniter/MySQL.
Additionally developed CMS which was used in 20 websites. Some of them are
ufaprint.ru_, ecorb.ru_, pushkin-dom.ru_, auto-victoria.ru_, etc.

**Software Engineer**, **Senior Software Engineer** at web studio `Parus Media`_
April 2006 — June 2007

Here I started websites development using PHP/MySQL. The biggest and the most
interesting of them was SamRU_. I worked on components such as forum, job board,
weather forecast widget, billboard, catalog of products, banner system, etc.
I wrote those service components from scratch, because it was not feasible to
integrate third-party ones into the project.

Education
---------

In 2005 I enrolled at Samara State Aerospace University and then in 2007 decided to
move to my hometown, so I continued the curriculum at
Ufa State Aviation Technical University which I graduated in 2012 with
Master's degree in Computer Science.
