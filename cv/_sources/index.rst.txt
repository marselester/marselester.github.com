I find professional satisfaction in building reliable services,
writing documentation and clear Go code.
I would like to learn more about systems performance.

Work Experience
---------------

**Site Reliability Engineer** at fintech startup Coins.ph_ ðŸš€
February 2021 â€” December 2022
**Software Architect**
August 2017 â€” September 2020
**Senior Software Engineer**
July 2014 â€” August 2017

- built a wallet service (Django, PostgreSQL) which helped the company grow from thousands to over **15 millions** of customers;
- designed a new ledger (Go, PostgreSQL, Kafka) to solve scalability issues and led the team focused on its delivery;
- ran an architecture guild meetings, gave talks about architecture,
  `Kafka <https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/marselester/kafka-for-gophers/kafka.slide>`_,
  `LSM storages <https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/marselester/storage-engines/log-structured-engine.slide>`_,
  `PostgreSQL <https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/marselester/storage-engines/postgres-lingo.slide>`_,
  `scalability of web services <https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/marselester/scalability/scalability.slide>`_,
  `SaltStack <https://slides.com/marselester/saltstack>`_;
- set up CI, and infrastructure based on SaltStack which
  helped to quickly provision dozens of EC2 instances to cope with exponential growth;
- introduced ELK, Prometheus, Jaeger to help developers with troubleshooting;
- decoupled and redesigned the core services from Flask monolith to scale them independently, e.g.,
  currency quotes service, account management service (sign up/in, TFA);
- helped with Go adoption (no ORM, web or testing frameworks):
  common `project structure <https://marselester.com/how-to-structure-go-projects.html>`_
  leveraging Go kit components (JSON/gRPC transports, telemetry, rate limiter, circuit breaker);
- improved code quality, architecture and advocated for both (conventions/proposals gardening similar to Go proposals);
- as a first remote developer helped to scale the engineering team which ended up working remotely;
- fostered an engineering culture of service ownership;
- been on-call to provide a quick incident response;

To try something different I joined infrastructure team as an SRE

- added horizontal/vertical pod autoscaling for 17 services which
  increased overall resiliency,
  helped to **handle x2 traffic, reduced infrastructure costs by 20%**;
- rewrote parts of 5 Django/Celery core services in Go to reduce memory (tens of gigabytes)
  and CPU consumption in Kubernetes cluster,
  see `gopher-celery <https://github.com/marselester/gopher-celery>`_;
- improved internal tooling, e.g., wrote a Terraform plugin to rotate PostgreSQL roles,
  implemented observability tool for Celery queues in Go,
  a dynamic service configuration based on AWS SSM, EventBridge, Kafka;
- introduced `continuous profiling <https://marselester.com/continuous-profiling-in-go.html>`_
  and reconstructed a `BPF agent <https://github.com/marselester/diy-parca-agent>`_ for fun;
- investigated and resolved API latency outliers, e.g.,
  `AWS SDK latency <https://github.com/marselester/awscreds>`_
  due to STS requests going to the global endpoint,
  and misconfigured SNS retry policy;

**Python Developer** contractor at icon fonts generator Fontastic_ (Webalys_) ðŸ¤Œ
January 2014 â€” July 2014

- improved project monetization with SVG sprite hosting and billing, e.g., implemented
  recurring PayPal payments, usage limits of font hosting,
  coroutine based AWS S3 and CloudFront log analyzer);
- introduced infrastructure as code (Ansible) to limit human errors;
- refactored and documented backend (Django, PostgreSQL) reducing tech debt;

**Python Developer** at cloud-based file upload SaaS Uploadcare_ ðŸ†™
November 2012 â€” August 2013

- integrated Stripe so that the company could start generating revenue;
- developed customer dashboards (Django, PostgreSQL);
- improved API client pyuploadcare_ (mass refactoring, documentation_, Python3 support, first major release);

**Python Developer** at concert organization startup FanGid.com_ ðŸ¤Ÿ
July 2012 â€” October 2012

- launched the project in 3 months (two developers) and it started to sell tickets;
- developed the following Django components:
  social auth, voting system, concert's pages, singer's profile page,
  displaying similar bands, email sending, monetization (tickets, orders, discounts, payments);
