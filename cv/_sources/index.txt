Work Experience
---------------

**Python Developer** at cloud-based file upload SaaS Uploadcare_
November 2012 — August 2013 (remote)

I started to work at Uploadcare from tasks that helped me find out their
infrastructure quicker (Django, Tornado, Flask). After that I engaged
mostly with Django (receiving payments through Stripe_, dashboard)
and maintaining pyuploadcare_ (mass refactoring, documentation_,
python 3 support, first major release).

**Python Developer** at social concert startup FanGid.com_
July 2012 — October 2012 (worked under contract)

I participated in development of requirements and architecture. While
constructing my basic tasks were social authorization, voting system,
concert's pages, artist's profile, tasks, which require Celery
(e.g., downloading similar artists, email sending), trading subsystem
(tickets, orders, discounts, payment). The organization of work via GitHub,
organization of unit and functional testing I attribute to my achievements.
