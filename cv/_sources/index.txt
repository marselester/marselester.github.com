Work Experience
---------------

**Senior Software Engineer** (Python/Go) at Coins.ph_, money transfer system based on Bitcoin
July 2014 — Present

In two months onboard I developed and released to production
the Bitcoin wallet system. I keep improving it still.
At the same time I set up continuous integration and infrastructure
based on SaltStack (production, staging, beta and sandbox servers).
Also I wrote a number of Python API clients.

All along I've been improving code quality,
decoupling services from the legacy monolithic system
towards a microservice architecture. For example, a currency quotes service,
an account service which provides JWT auth flow.

**Python Developer** at icon fonts generator Fontastic_ (Webalys_)
January 2014 — July 2014 (remote)

Django code quality improvement (refactoring, tests, documentation, bug fixes),
helping with infrastructure based on Ansible. Also I worked on billing
(recurring PayPal payments, font hosting limitation control,
coroutine based S3 and CloudFront log analyzer) and SVG sprite hosting.

**Python Developer** at open incubator Joltem_
October 2013 — November 2013 (remote)

**Python Developer** at cloud-based file upload SaaS Uploadcare_
November 2012 — August 2013 (remote)

mostly with Django (receiving payments by Stripe_, dashboard)
and maintaining API library pyuploadcare_ (mass refactoring, documentation_,
Python 3 support, first major release).
