<p>It is important for me to solve meaningful problems with high impact.
I find professional satisfaction in building reliable services, reasoning about their boundaries,
writing documentation and clear code.</p>

<h2>Work Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#work-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> (Python/Go), <strong>Software Architect</strong> (since August 2017) at fintech startup <a class="reference external" href="https://coins.ph">Coins.ph</a> üöÄ
July 2014 ‚Äî September 2020</p>
<p>I developed a wallet service (multi-currency payments including Bitcoin/Ethereum)
which helped the company to grow from thousands to over 10 millions of customers.
Later I designed a new ledger (Go, PostgreSQL, Kafka) to solve scalability issues,
and led the team that focused on its delivery.</p>
<p>In early days I set up infrastructure based on SaltStack.
It helped to quickly provision dozens of EC2 instances to cope with exponential growth (it‚Äôs Kubernetes nowadays).
I introduced ELK, Prometheus, Jaeger to help developers with troubleshooting.</p>
<p>I also decoupled and refactored services from Flask monolith to scale them independently, e.g.,
currency quotes service, account management service (sign up/in, TFA).</p>
<p>All along I‚Äôve been improving code quality, architecture and advocating for both
(conventions/proposals gardening similar to Go proposals).</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at icon fonts generator <a class="reference external" href="http://fontastic.me">Fontastic</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.webalys.com">Webalys</a>) üôÇ
January 2014 ‚Äî July 2014</p>
<p>As a contractor I started with Django code quality improvements
(refactoring, writing tests/docs) and infrastructure as code (Ansible).</p>
<p>Then I focused on improving project monetization:
SVG sprite hosting and billing (recurring PayPal payments, usage limits of font hosting,
coroutine based AWS S3 and CloudFront log analyzer).</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at cloud-based file upload SaaS <a class="reference external" href="https://uploadcare.com">Uploadcare</a> üÜô
November 2012 ‚Äî August 2013</p>
<p>I helped with customer dashboards, monetization (payments integration with Stripe),
and maintaining API library <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare">pyuploadcare</a> (mass refactoring, <a class="reference external" href="https://pyuploadcare.readthedocs.org">documentation</a>,
Python 3 support, first major release).</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at concert organization startup <a class="reference external" href="http://fangid.com">FanGid.com</a> ü§ü
July 2012 ‚Äî October 2012</p>
<p>Right after graduation I met a concerts organizer who was looking for developers to build a startup.
The idea was to gauge music fans interest, bring most wanted musicians, and sell tickets.
I pitched it to a fellow developer, and we launched the project in 3 months.</p>
<p>I helped to set up the project‚Äôs foundation and system‚Äôs architecture.
Then I worked on the following Django components:
social auth, voting system, concert‚Äôs pages, singer‚Äôs profile page,
displaying similar bands, email sending, monetization (tickets, orders, discounts, payments).</p>

<p>I had started my career in small web studios.</p>
<p><strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at web studio <a class="reference external" href="http://bestweb.ru">Bestweb</a> üëç
August 2007 ‚Äî January 2012</p>
<p>Still studying at university I continued my work on standard corporate websites
but this time using CodeIgniter (PHP framework).
To my best knowledge about 20 websites ran on a CMS I developed.</p>

April 2006 ‚Äî June 2007</p>
<p>In my freshman/sophomore years I worked as a full stack developer of standard corporate websites
using vanilla PHP and MySQL.
The most challenging project was a regional portal <a class="reference external" href="http://www.samru.ru">SamRU</a> (~80K pageviews per day)
for which I wrote the following modules:
forum, job board, weather forecast widget, billboard, catalog of products, banner system, etc.</p>

<p>In 2005 I enrolled in Samara State Aerospace University and then in 2007 decided to
move to my hometown, so I continued the curriculum at
Ufa State Aviation Technical University from which I graduated in 2012 with
Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science.</p>
