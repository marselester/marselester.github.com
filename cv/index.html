<p>It is important for me to solve meaningful problems with high impact.
I find professional satisfaction in designing services, reasoning about their boundaries,
writing documentation and clear code (nowadays in Go).</p>

<h2>Work Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#work-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Software Architect</strong> (since August 2017) at fintech startup <a class="reference external" href="https://coins.ph">Coins.ph</a> üöÄ
July 2014 ‚Äî September 2020</p>
<p>Two months onboard I developed a basic wallet (ledger) which helped the company to widen its reach
and broaden financial inclusion in the Philippines.
I had been maintaining and improving it for 4 years as the company has grown to serve over 10 millions of customers.</p>
<p>At the same time I focused on decoupling services from a monolithic system.
For example, currency quotes service, account management service.
In early days of Coins I set up continuous integration and infrastructure based on SaltStack.</p>
<p>With a rapid growth I desperately needed help with systems I was entrusted
and luckily a few engineers whom I knew professionally joined the team
consequently hiring more like-minded ones.
They took the company to the next level gradually replacing previous solutions
as well as raising the bar for engineering (<a class="reference external" href="https://stackshare.io/coins-ph/coins">current stack</a>).</p>
<p>All along I‚Äôve been improving code quality, architecture and advocating for both.
With growing engineering team I dedicated more time and effort to knowledge sharing (docs/talks)
to add historical perspective on why certain technical decisions were made,
where we are approximately heading, how we make trade-offs and work comfortably as a team
(conventions/proposals gardening).
Basically helping smart people solve hard problems and get out of their way.
Thus I have gradually drifted out of writing code into helping fellow developers as an architect and a team lead.</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at icon fonts generator <a class="reference external" href="http://fontastic.me">Fontastic</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.webalys.com">Webalys</a>) üôÇ
January 2014 ‚Äî July 2014</p>
<p>As a contractor I started with Django code quality improvements
(refactoring, writing tests/documentation, bug fixes),
helped with infrastructure based on Ansible. Then focused on project monetisation functionality:
SVG sprite hosting and billing (recurring PayPal payments, usage limits of font hosting,
coroutine based AWS S3 and CloudFront log analyzer).</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at cloud-based file upload SaaS <a class="reference external" href="https://uploadcare.com">Uploadcare</a> üÜô
November 2012 ‚Äî August 2013</p>
<p>At Uploadcare I was assigned first with tasks that helped me to get familiar with
the infrastructure quicker (Django, Tornado, Flask, Chef). After that I engaged
mostly with Django (payments integration with Stripe, customer dashboard)
and maintaining API library <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare">pyuploadcare</a> (mass refactoring, <a class="reference external" href="https://pyuploadcare.readthedocs.org">documentation</a>,
Python 3 support, first major release).</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at concert organization startup <a class="reference external" href="http://fangid.com">FanGid.com</a> ü§ü
July 2012 ‚Äî October 2012</p>
<p>Right after graduation I met a concerts organizer who was looking for developers to build a startup.
The idea was to gauge music fans interest in a particular artist in a certain city, bring most wanted musicians, and sell tickets.
I pitched it to a fellow developer whose expertise I trust and together we split responsibilities and launched the project in 3 months.</p>
<p>I had participated in setting up the project‚Äôs foundation and system‚Äôs architecture.
During my time there I worked on the following Django components:
social auth, voting system, concert‚Äôs pages, singer‚Äôs profile page,
displaying similar bands, email sending, monetisation (tickets, orders, discounts, payments).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I had started my career in small web studios.</p>
<p><strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at web studio <a class="reference external" href="http://bestweb.ru">Bestweb</a> üëç
August 2007 ‚Äî January 2012</p>
<p>Still studying at university I continued my work on standard corporate websites
but this time using CodeIgniter (PHP framework).
To my best knowledge about 20 websites ran on a CMS I developed.</p>
<p><strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at web studio <a class="reference external" href="http://mediaidea.ru">Parus Media</a> ‚õµÔ∏è
April 2006 ‚Äî June 2007</p>
<p>In my freshman/sophomore years I worked as a full stack developer of standard corporate websites
using vanilla PHP and MySQL. Back then it was also popular to make your own CMS or CRM.
The most challenging project was a regional portal <a class="reference external" href="http://www.samru.ru">SamRU</a> (~80K pageviews per day)
for which I wrote the following modules:
forum, job board, weather forecast widget, billboard, catalog of products, banner system, etc.</p>

<p>In 2005 I enrolled in Samara State Aerospace University and then in 2007 decided to
move to my hometown, so I continued the curriculum at
Ufa State Aviation Technical University from which I graduated in 2012 with
Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science.</p>
