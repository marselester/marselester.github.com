<h2>Work Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#work-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> (Python/Go) at <a class="reference external" href="https://coins.ph">Coins.ph</a>, financial services based on Bitcoin
July 2014 — Present</p>
<p>In two months onboard I developed the wallet system which is our core service.
I keep improving it still.</p>
<p>At the same time I set up continuous integration and infrastructure
based on SaltStack (production, staging, beta and sandbox servers).
Also I wrote a number of Python API clients.</p>
<p>All along I’ve been improving code quality &amp; architecture and advocating for both,
decoupling services from the legacy monolithic system
towards microservices. For example, the currency quotes service,
the account service which provides auth flow.</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at icon fonts generator <a class="reference external" href="http://fontastic.me">Fontastic</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.webalys.com">Webalys</a>)
January 2014 — July 2014 (remote)</p>
<p>I started with Django code quality improvements (refactoring, tests, documentation, bug fixes),
helping with infrastructure based on Ansible. Also I worked on billing
(recurring PayPal payments, font hosting limitation control,
coroutine based S3 and CloudFront log analyzer) and SVG sprite hosting.</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at open software projects incubator <a class="reference external" href="http://joltem.com">Joltem</a>
October 2013 — November 2013 (remote)</p>
<p>I had joined the project (it used Django, Twisted) when infrastructure
was not set up, so I participated in setting it up based on SaltStack,
refactoring Django project.</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at social advertising platform <a class="reference external" href="http://sociate.ru">Sociate</a>
August 2013 — September 2013 (remote)</p>
<p>Mainly I was involved in Odnoklassniki API integration with Django,
e.g., I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marselester/pyodnoklassniki">Odnoklassniki REST API wrapper</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at cloud-based file upload SaaS <a class="reference external" href="https://uploadcare.com">Uploadcare</a>
November 2012 — August 2013 (remote)</p>
<p>I started to work at Uploadcare from tasks that helped me to get familiar with
the infrastructure quicker (Django, Tornado, Flask, Chef). After that I engaged
mostly with Django (payments integration with <a class="reference external" href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, customer dashboard)
and maintaining API library <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare">pyuploadcare</a> (mass refactoring, <a class="reference external" href="https://pyuploadcare.readthedocs.org">documentation</a>,
Python 3 support, first major release).</p>
<p><strong>Python Developer</strong> at concert organization startup <a class="reference external" href="http://fangid.com">FanGid.com</a>
July 2012 — October 2012</p>
<p>Right after graduation I met a guy who was looking for developers to build a startup.
As I joined early on, I had participated in setting project
foundation and system architecture. During my time there I worked on social authorization,
voting system, concert’s pages, singer’s profile, downloading similar bands,
email sending, trading subsystem (tickets, orders, discounts, payments).</p>

Additionally developed CMS which was used in 20 websites. Some of them are
<a class="reference external" href="http://ufaprint.ru">ufaprint.ru</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://ecorb.ru">ecorb.ru</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://pushkin-dom.ru">pushkin-dom.ru</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://auto-victoria.ru">auto-victoria.ru</a>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at web studio <a class="reference external" href="http://mediaidea.ru">Parus Media</a>

<p>Here I started websites development using PHP/MySQL. The biggest and the most
interesting of them was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.samru.ru">SamRU</a>. I worked on components such as forum, job board,
weather forecast widget, billboard, catalog of products, banner system, etc.
I wrote those service components from scratch, because it was not feasible to
integrate third-party ones into the project.</p>
