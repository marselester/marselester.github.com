About

Hi, my name is Marsel.

I'm a Python developer. Except that I like to travel,
drive motorcycles and running. Occasionally I live in Thailand.
I used to be an artist and studied at gymnasium of Art,
but I had changed interests and wanted to be a programmer.
I've been developing applications since that moment,
most of them are web apps.
