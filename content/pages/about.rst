About
=====

Hi, my name is Marsel.

I am a `Python & Go developer <https://github.com/marselester>`_
interested in distributed systems and machine learning.

I like to travel, `ride motorcycles`_, and running.
I live in Thailand and travel around South East Asia from time to time.

I had studied Art since early childhood, but by the age of fourteen I became passionate about programming.
I've been developing applications ever since, most of them are web apps.
