About

Hi, my name is Marsel.

I am a Python and Go developer. Moreover, I like to travel,
`ride motorcycles`_ and running. Occasionally I live in Thailand and
travel around, e.g., Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam.
I used to be an artist and studied at gymnasium of Art,
but I had changed interests and wanted to be a programmer.
I've been developing applications since that moment,
most of them are web apps.
