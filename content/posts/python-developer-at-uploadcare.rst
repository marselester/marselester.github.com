I started to look for a full-time remote job as a Python Developer after
`FanGid <http://fangid.com/>`_ contract has been ended. And I found what
I was looking for -- `Uploadcare <https://uploadcare.com>`_, a cloud-based
file upload SaaS -- `great team <https://github.com/uploadcare?tab=members>`_,
appropriate development process, adherence to quality standards.

I started to work at Uploadcare from tasks that helped me find out their
infrastructure quicker (Django, Tornado, Flask). After that I have been
engaging mostly with Django (receiving payments through
`Stripe <http://stripe.com>`_, dashboard) and maintaining
`pyuploadcare <https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare>`_ (mass refactoring,
`documentation <https://pyuploadcare.readthedocs.org>`_, python 3 support,
first major release).

I worked in `Thailand and Vietnam <http://instagram.com/marselester>`_ meanwhile.
